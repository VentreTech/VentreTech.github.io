                    <p>I am a software developer. I began in software as a lawyer, starting
               a bootstrapped SaaS business that automated legal processes in the
               areas of elder law kyspecialneedsplanning.com
               and family law (kydivorcekits.com). I transitioned to full time
               consulting in 2016, forming Ventre Tech. My primarily languages
               are Python (proficiant), JavaScript (proficient), and Ruby
               (prior professional experience).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                  <p>I have created a number of web applications in different
                frameworks, including Django, Meteor, Node.js, Jekyll and Ruby on
                Rails. I love Clojure/ClojureScript and am looking for an excuse
                to use it professionally. On the front end, I have used
                both React.js and Angular 1 professionally. I have also ventured
                into mobile development with React Native.
                I follow a TDD style and know my way around Selenium, Jasmine,
                and Karma.
