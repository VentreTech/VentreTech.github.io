                    <p>I am a software developer who lives in Lexington, KY.
                       I am also an attorney, though I shut down my private
                       practice to pursue programming. Although I have set up
                       websites and been a linux user since my childhood,
                       I stumbled across Python while trying to set up an
                       automated service to provide indigent Kentuckians 
                       with access to the legal system. After pursuing a number
                       of projects in Python, Django, and Javascript,
                       I shuttered my law practice to pursue full time
                       work as a developer.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                  <p>I have created a number of websites with Wordpress,
                      Jekyll, and Django, as well as Wagtail (a CMS solution for Django)
                      and the Django Rest Framework. I've used JQuery and
                      Angular for the front end of several projects. I follow
                      test driven development style. Testing libraries I am
                      familiar with include:
                      Selenium (for end to end testing), Jasmine (for
                      javascript unit tests), Django's built in unit test suite
                      and the Karma test runner.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      In addition to building web applications, I've also spent quite a bit 
                      of time on automated document generation with Python.
                      Although I primarily use Python and Javascript, I have also
                      used a bit of Scala and Ruby.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      I am a big believer in the utility of the techniques of
                      functional programming, and their ability to improve the
                      intelligibility and testability of code. For that reason,
                      I have a strong interest in Scala, functional Javascript
                      libraries (especially Ramda.js), and Scheme.
